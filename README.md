Vim file navigation for Elixir projects

[online source](https://github.com/andyl/vim-projectionist-elixir)

This plugin supplies quick-nav links for Elixir projects.  It
gives commands to jump quickly between an Elixir source file
and it's associated test.

Main commands:

`:A` - open the 'alternate' file

`:AS` - open the 'alternate' file in a split window

`:AV` - open the 'alternate' file in a vertical split window

`:AT` - open the 'alternate' file in another tab

This work is based on Tim Pope's
[vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist)
plugin.
